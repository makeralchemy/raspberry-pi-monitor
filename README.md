# Monitor for Raspberry Pi Status
'monitor.py' is a  Python program used to display Raspberry Pi status on an Adafruit SSD1306 compatible display.
The program uses four lines on the display to show the hostname, IP address, CPU load, and memory usage.
On the far right of first line line, a heart icon blinks (aka a heart beat) to show that Raspberry Pi is alive and not hung or stopped.
When terminated the program will display the number of heart beats recorded from the time the program was started.
